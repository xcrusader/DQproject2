Y Combinator a startup incubator, hosts a site called Hacker News. The site contains posts (or stories as they are called in Hacker News) submitted by users which can be voted or commented on. 

In this project we analyse a sample of about 20000 posts to find out:

    - which post type recieved more comments on average - There are two types of posts namely Show posts wherein a user is exhibiting his/ her body of work including project or articles for comments from users and Ask posts whereing the user is looking for an answer to a query.
    - whether the time the post was created on has influence on the average number of comments.

The focus of this project was to get a deeper understanding of  basic concepts in python and to get familiar with the analysis of data associated to date time. In this project I have attempted to use dataframes and improve the data viz along with libraries associated to date time.

The project is best rendered https://nbviewer.org/
